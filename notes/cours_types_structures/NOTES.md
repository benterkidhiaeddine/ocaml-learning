# Decide Between Variants VS Records VS Tuples

- Length :
  - Unbounded :
    Lists
    Arrays
  - Bounded :
    - Acess :
      - By name :
        Records
      - By position
        Tuples

# Link Between These data types and Set Theory

- Records and Tuples are like : each-of types cartesian products : We want a colletion of data that is associated with one another there is the logical AND

- Vairants algebraic data types , one-of types , sum types or tagged unions are like the Sum of possibilites of each of the Constructors in the vairant : There is a disjoint Union and the logical OR
